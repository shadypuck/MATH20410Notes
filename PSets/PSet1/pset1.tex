\section{Differentiation}
\emph{From \textcite{bib:Rudin}.}
\subsection*{Chapter 5}
\begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{\arabic*.}}]
    \item Let $f$ be defined for all real $x$, and suppose that
    \begin{equation*}
        |f(y)-f(x)| \leq (y-x)^2
    \end{equation*}
    for all real $x$ and $y$. Prove that $f$ is constant.
    \item Suppose $f'(x)>0$ in $(a,b)$. Prove that $f$ is strictly increasing in $(a,b)$ and let $g$ be its inverse function. Prove that $g$ is differentiable, and that
    \begin{equation*}
        g'(f(x)) = \frac{1}{f'(x)}
    \end{equation*}
    for $a<x<b$.
    \item Suppose $g$ is a real function on $\R^1$, with bounded derivative (say $|g'|\leq M$). Fix $\epsilon>0$ and define $f(x)=x+\epsilon g(x)$. Prove that $f$ is one-to-one if $\epsilon$ is small enough. (A set of admissable values of $\epsilon$ can be determined which depends only on $M$.)
    \item If
    \begin{equation*}
        C_0+\frac{C_1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{C_{n-1}}{n}+\frac{C_n}{n+1} = 0
    \end{equation*}
    where $C_0,\dots,C_n$ are real constants, prove that the equation
    \begin{equation*}
        C_0+C_1x+\cdots+C_{n-1}x^{n-1}+C_nx^n = 0
    \end{equation*}
    has at least one real root between 0 and 1.
    \item Suppose $f$ is defined and differentiable for every $x>0$, and $f'(x)\to 0$ as $x\to+\infty$. Put $g(x)=f(x+1)-f(x)$. Prove that $g(x)\to 0$ as $x\to+\infty$.
\end{enumerate}
